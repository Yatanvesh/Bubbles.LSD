Bubbles on LSD

Witness thousands(4000 to be exact) of bubbles erupt and take over your screen as you slowly immerse in them. Slowly they shall take over everything. This Project was originally a fork of my Galactic-Junkies project as the original Bubble class belongs to it (named Sparkles) but all the functionality of the original project has been removed conserving only the required parts.

Compilation on Linux:
1. Install package sfml using pacman or libsfml-dev using apt-get
2. run make.sh to build and run the game

Compilation on Windows(Visual Studio):
Pretty hefty so just follow one of the many guides to setup visual studio with SFML:

The game takes one optional command line argument- the resolution of the Window
Since it is a square window only one argument is required and the default is set to 1080 (for 1080p screens)
